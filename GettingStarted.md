# VCS GUI Getting Started (Decentralized Workflow)

This guide is for users who already understand Git-like workflows, but are new to decentralized collaboration in this project.

For full UI reference, see `Manual.md`.

## 1. Quick Mental Model

In this project:

- You still work locally (stage, commit, diff, branch) like normal Git.
- Nodes discover each other as peers and exchange signed operations via gossip.
- Pushes are proposal-based: a push is queued, then finalized after consensus (vote + certify), then processed.

So the biggest change is: `push` can be pending until consensus state allows it to complete.

## 2. Build and Launch

From the repository root:

```bash
go build -o vcs .
cargo run --manifest-path gui/Cargo.toml
```

In the GUI top bar:

- Set `Repository` to your repo path.
- Set `vcs binary` to the built CLI binary path (for example `./vcs`).

If you see `No such file or directory (os error 2)` in output, the `vcs binary` path is incorrect.

## 3. First Local Workflow (Single Node)

Use the `Staging` tab:

1. Stage files (`Stage all` or `Stage file`).
2. Commit (`Commit` or `Commit all`).
3. Review diff and repo status.

Use the `Collaboration` tab:

1. Click `List pending queue` to inspect push queue state.
2. Use `Push` in `Git Operations` when ready.
3. Use `Process pending pushes` after proposal/vote/certification conditions are met.

## 4. Minimal Two-Node Collaboration Flow

Assume Node A and Node B are each running a daemon and can reach each other.

1. Add peers in `Node + Peers` on both nodes.
2. Node A creates commits and clicks `Push` (auto-proposal is generated).
3. In `Proposals`, use `Use ID`, then vote/certify from participating nodes.
4. Run `Sync now` and `Process pending pushes`.
5. Verify pending entry moves toward `completed`.

Use `Operation Feed` and `Pending Pushes` to understand current state.

## 5. Suggested First Session (10-15 Minutes)

1. Make one commit and push.
2. Observe pending push behavior.
3. Run `Sync now`.
4. Cast a vote and certify.
5. Process pending pushes and confirm completion.

That sequence gives the fastest understanding of what differs from centralized Git.

## 6. Common Gotchas

- `HEAD` errors on a new repo: create an initial commit first.
- Empty peer/proposal panels: confirm you selected the intended repository path.
- Command failures: check `Last Command Output` first; it is the primary debugging panel.

## 7. License Context (Important)

- This repository is licensed under Apache 2.0 (`LICENSE`).
- The project interoperates with Git (GPLv2) by invoking Git as an external tool/wrapper layer.
- Keep third-party dependency licenses intact when redistributing binaries or source.

For legal decisions beyond normal compliance checks, consult counsel.

## 8. GUI Scope vs CLI Scope

The GUI currently exposes many common workflows, but not every operation.

- If a function is missing in the GUI, check the `vcs` CLI first.
- The `vcs` binary is the primary interface layer and wraps Git-style behavior for many commands.
- In practice, advanced or newly added features may appear in CLI before they are added to the GUI.
